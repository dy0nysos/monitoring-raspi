# monitoring-raspi

This project allows you to check your server services status.
It uses a raspberry (B in my case), an 16x2 LCD screen and some leds.

## Why Java ?
I really like using my raspberry but, I'm not cumfortable with Python so I decided to translate the python LCD screen algorith in Java.

## How to use it ?

You might need to modify GPIO pin affectation into LcdDisplay.java file to match your wiring.
The project needs some tweaks to be based on properties files to be more fexible.

Fork it and have fun !
